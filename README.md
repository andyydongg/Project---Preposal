## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Its like a clock, but the clock would have different backgorunds or animations when it's a special time of the day (12 0'clock at noon, midnight) 
and when that day is a holiday (Christmas, Newyears, Thankgiving, National Star Day). The code could be tested with an input function asking for a date. 
For a couple of days out of the year, there could be a small game included. 
So in sense it would be like a calendar of some sort, with animations, reminders about special events, 
and maybe something like fun facts (which could be links to YouTube and other random stuff).
